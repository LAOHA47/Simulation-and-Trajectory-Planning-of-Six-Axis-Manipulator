# Simulation-and-Trajectory-Planning-of-Six-Axis-Manipulator
Compared the standard DH method and the improved DH method; established the kinematics model of the manipulator with the improved DH method in MATLAB
Performed forward and inverse kinematics simulations of the manipulator and finished trajectory planning and result analysis of line, arc, and polynomial fitting
